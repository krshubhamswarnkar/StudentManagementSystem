The Student Management System is a web-based application built using Java, Spring Boot, HTML, and Thymeleaf. It allows you to manage student information such as roll number, name, and email. The application provides features to list, add, delete, and update student information.

Technologies Used
Java: Backend programming language used for implementing business logic.
Spring Boot: Framework for building Java-based web applications.
HTML: Markup language used for creating the user interface.
Thymeleaf: Server-side Java templating engine for generating dynamic HTML pages.
Features
List all students: View a comprehensive list of all students, including their roll number, name, and email.

Add student: Create a new student by providing their roll number, name, and email.

Update student information: Modify the details of an existing student, such as their roll number, name, or email.

Delete student: Remove a student from the system.

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Apache Maven
MySQL or any other compatible relational database management system
Setup and Installation

The HTML templates can be modified to enhance the user interface, add additional fields, or improve the overall user experience.
